			<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em;"> Snippy is the beloved cat of Edna Cayford, a driver 
				for horse-drawn carriages in Stanley Park. A short while ago, Snippy's appetite changed dramatically, and he began losing weight rapidly. 
				Concerned, Edna brought Snippy to our clinic for an evaluation. After a thorough examination, we diagnosed Snippy with diabetes. Catching it 
				early was crucial, as it allowed us to start a treatment plan promptly. With dedicated care and regular insulin injections, Snippy's health 
				has improved significantly. Despite facing this challenge, Snippy remains an active and cherished member of Edna's family.
